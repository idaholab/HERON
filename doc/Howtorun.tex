\section{ Installation and how to run}
\subsection{Installation}
As a plugin of RAVEN, HERON is installed as a submodule. RAVEN maintains up-to-date
instructions for plugin installation in its manuals and other documentation. As of this writing, plugins
are installed from the command line from within the top level of the RAVEN repository as
\begin{verbatim}
scripts/install_plugins.py ‐s heron
\end{verbatim}
Note that RAVEN must be installed completely to use HERON and its components. At this writing
HERON introduces one additional Python library to the standard set of RAVEN \texttt{Python} dependencies:
\texttt{dill}. The serialization package \texttt{dill} enables information transfer between the HERON templating
algorithm and dispatching algorithm not possible with the standard library set. This library, along with
any future additional libraries required, should be installed correctly via RAVEN’s documented
installation procedure for including plugins.
HERON also requires use of the RAVEN plugin\textt{tCashFlow} , a utility for economic analysis.
As of this writing, \texttt{CashFlow} is an officially supported plugin for RAVEN and is installed standard when plugins are included in RAVEN installation. 
\subsection{How to run}
The code can be run easily on a \texttt{linux/mac} system by defining an alias to the \texttt{Python} script `\texttt{main.py}' in the \texttt{src} folder of  HERON.
