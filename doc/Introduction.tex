\section{Introduction}
HERON is a generic software plugin of RAVEN to perform stochastic technoeconomic analysis of grid energy-resource systems with economic drivers. The development targets analysis of electricity and
secondary product generation and consumption in regional balancing areas, including flexibility to include arbitrary resources as well as arbitrary resource consumers and producers. HERON is developed to drive optimization via economic drivers such as system cost minimization, profitability, and net present value (NPV) maximization. As a plugin of RAVEN, HERON provides two primary functions: the automatic generation of RAVEN workflows, and models for optimizing high-resolution dispatch of arbitrary systems including resources, resource consumers, and resource producers. HERON leverages the synthetic history training and generation tools, sampling workflows, code Application Programming Interfaces (API), and optimization schemes.
