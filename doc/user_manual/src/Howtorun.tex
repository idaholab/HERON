\section{ Installation and how to run}

\subsection{Installation}
As a plugin of RAVEN, HERON is installed as a submodule. RAVEN maintains up-to-date instructions for
plugin installation in its documentation
(\href{https://github.com/idaholab/raven/wiki/Plugins}{see the link to the Raven plugin
installation}.

\subsection{How to run}
Directly running HERON through RAVEN has not finished implementation. To run HERON, use Python to
run the script in \texttt{heron/src/main.py} with the HERON XML input as argument.
