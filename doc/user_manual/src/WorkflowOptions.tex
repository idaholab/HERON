\section{Workflow Options}
HERON has the capability to run different workflows, which expands the flexibility and capabilities of this plugin. Currently, HERON inputs control the workflow selection via

\xmlNode{workflow}, which exists as a subnode of \xmlNode{case}. Each workflow approaches the Technoeconomic Analysis(TEA) with a unique problem formulation and solution

technique.

\subsection{Default}
The default HERON workflow primarily utilizes RAVEN. In this workflow, RAVEN runs RAVEN to solve a two-level representation of the TEA by utilizing both pyomo and RAVEN's

gradient descent optimizer. To run this workflow, insert "standard" into \xmlNode{workflow} or simply do not define this node as this workflow will remain the default.
