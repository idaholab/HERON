    Determines transfer coefficient between steam and electricity (i.e. efficiency) as a time series.
    This example uses a Sine wave as a proxy for varying temperature throughout the day and simulates
    decrease in power cycle efficiency when air temperatures are high (for an air-cooled plant).

    NOTE: the information within `data` should be in a specific format. User must specify what
    data type is being returned in the `ratio_type` entry:
      - data['ratio_type'] : str, could be either 'lists' **or** 'custom_pyomo'
    Then, in an entry of the same name, the user must report back the values in a nested dictionary.
    For the `lists` option, the nested dictionary should look like:
        * data['lists']['__reference'] = <name_of_reference_resource>
        * data['lists']['<other_resource>'] = <list_of_ratios_indexed_by_time>
